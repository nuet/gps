GG-Tracker
==========
GG-Tracker is a simple OpenGTS server and will also work with any client or
app that submits data according to the $GPRMC standard defined by Garmin.

Live demo at http://tracker.eppenga.com/

Please note that you can choose any username, password, ID that you like.
The credentials can be used in the $secret_key setting in config.php, but 
it's not required to do so.

Is it tested?
=============
One thing I know for sure, it works on my setup, that is:

Google Nexus 7 Phone
GPSTrackerLite v1.0.15
Apache 2.2.4
PHP 5.2.0
MySQL 5.0.27

The list of apps that I have tested positive together with GG-Tracker is:
GPS2OpenGTS (Trial) - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wiebej.gps2opengtsfree
GPS2OpenGTS (Paid) - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wiebej.gps2opengts
GPSLogger - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger
GPSTrackerLite - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.softinnovation.gpstrackerlite

If it will work on your setup, that's up to you :)

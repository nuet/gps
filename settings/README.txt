This folder contains screenshots of my settings to be used as an example.

I used the app GPSTrackerLite as a client (which works good and is free), 
but you can use any app that follows the $GPRMC or OpenGTS standards. 
There are many out there!

Please note that you can choose any username, password, ID that you like.
The credentials can be used in the $secret_key setting in config.php, but 
it's not required to do so. As long as the credentials are part of the
URL string of the client you selected GG-Tracker will authenticate.

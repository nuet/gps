Server installation
===================
This is your typical 1 minute installation manual.

* Install into a folder on your PHP enabled webbrowser.
* Modify config.php where necessary.
* Create a MySQL database
* Create the MySQL table using 'gg-tracker.sql'
* Browse to http://<your-domain.com>/<installedfolder>/index.php

Hard- en software requirements
=============================
You need a few things to run GG-Tracker and track you cellphone or device.

* Apache 2.0 or better
* PHP 5.2 or better
* MySQL 5.0 or better
* Cellphone (or any device you like to track)
* An app that runs as a client on your device, please also see below
  
App settings
============
GG-Tracker can connect to almost any app that supports OpenGTS and/or 
(NMEA/)$GPRMC. The 'settings' folder contains example setups including 
screenshot from the Android app "GPSTrackerLite" which is freely available.
Other tested apps are "GPS2OpenGTS" (trial and paid) and "GPSLogger" (free).

Please set it up to your likings, below are some important settings:

* OpenGTS Server
  Server address (dns or ip) and port: <your website, ie: tracker.eppenga.com>
* OpenGTS Server Path
  Path to put.php, ie: /gps/put.php (GPSTrackerLite). Please note that some
  apps require an additional '?', in that case the path is: /gps/put.php?
  (GPS2OpenGTS uses an extra '?' at the end).
* OpenGTS Server Port
  Port to your website, in almost any case this is: 80
* Username / Device ID / Vehicle ID
  Leaving this empty is easiest to start with, later you can use this to 
  secure your communications between the app and GG-Tracker. Please use the
  $secury_key in the config.php in that case.
* Transmission protocol
  Always choose an http(s) based protocol, GG-Tracker does not support UDP.
